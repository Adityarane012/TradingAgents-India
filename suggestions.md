# TradingAgents — India-First Optimization Guide

> **Philosophy**: Indian markets have distinct structural characteristics — two major exchanges (NSE/BSE), SEBI regulations, FII/DII flow dynamics, derivatives-heavy retail participation, and a rich bilingual social media ecosystem. This guide rewires every layer of TradingAgents to treat India as the primary market.

## Status — every section rechecked against the code on 2026-09-22

✅ done · ⚠️ done differently (the suggestion was wrong or unsafe) · ❌ not done,
with the reason. Items marked ❌ that are worth doing later are in
`future_plans.md`. The body below this table is the original guide. Symbols and
series in it that turned out to be dead are marked inline, so none is copied by
mistake.

| § | Suggestion | Status | Where / why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Indian tickers work out of the box | ✅ | Verified. The quick-reference list now uses `TMCV.NS`; `TATAMOTORS.NS` 404s since the demerger. |
| 2.1 | India-first news queries | ✅ | Automatic for `.NS`/`.BO`: `REGIONAL_NEWS_QUERIES` (issues.md I-005). |
| 2.2 | Disable / repurpose FRED | ✅ | Already worked; kept on. Its India series are used with staleness warnings. |
| 2.3 | Benchmark `^NSEI` | ✅ | Automatic from the ticker suffix (`default_config.py`). |
| 2.4 | Output language | ✅ | `TRADINGAGENTS_OUTPUT_LANGUAGE` works as described. |
| 3.1 | FRED India aliases | ⚠️ | Added, except `INTDSRINM193N` ("RBI lending rate"), which died in July 2022. Live RBI rates are scraped from rbi.org.in instead (`rbi_rates.py`). |
| 3.2 | Global series + crude oil | ✅ | The FRED aliases existed. **Crude added 2026-09-22**: Brent and USD/INR go to the news analyst (`india_relative.commodity_fx_block`). |
| 3.3 | NSE India API | ✅ | `nse_india.py`: FII/DII, India VIX, Nifty level, PCR, shareholding, corporate actions and announcements. The sketch in §3.3 is wrong: its endpoint 404s and its cookie handshake is unneeded. |
| 3.4 | RBI DBIE | ⚠️ | DBIE's certificate is broken; repo/SDF/MSF/CRR/SLR come from the rbi.org.in homepage. **Not done:** WPI, forex reserves, external debt (see future_plans.md). |
| 4.1 | Indian retail platforms | ⚠️ | Reddit India subs ✅, StockTwits ✅, and since 2026-09-22 Google News India carries Moneycontrol/ET/Mint headlines without scraping them. X ❌ (paid, $100+/mo). Telegram ❌ (needs a bot and joined channels; no search API). Marketaux ❌ (free plan: 3 articles per request, no sentiment). |
| 4.2 | Indian subreddits | ⚠️ | Region-routed, not the one-line swap, which would have degraded US tickers. r/DalalStreet was dropped: no posts since Jan 2024. |
| 4.3 | StockTwits suffix | ⚠️ | A verified ADR allowlist. Stripping the suffix mapped TCS→Container Store and ITC→a US utility. |
| 4.4 | X/Twitter | ❌ | Paid API, and this is a zero-budget project. |
| 5.1 | Trading hours | ❌ by design | Static facts the model already knows; this pipeline works on daily bars, so session times never change an answer. Adding them costs tokens on every call. |
| 5.2 | India calendar events | ⚠️ | The prompts name RBI MPC, Budget, F&O expiry and FII/DII as things to watch. **Real event dates are not fetched** (see future_plans.md). The expiry weekday is deliberately not named, because NSE has changed it. |
| 5.3 | SEBI circuit rules, T+1 | ❌ by design | Same reason as 5.1. The limits also vary by stock band, so a hardcoded table would mislead. |
| 5.4 | Sector index comparison | ✅ **added 2026-09-22** | `india_relative.relative_strength_block`, for the market analyst. Only Nifty Bank, IT and Pharma have price history on Yahoo; the other sector indices return one bar. So most sectors use an equal-weighted basket of Nifty 50 peers. |
| 6.1 | News analyst India macro | ✅ | Uses the corrected aliases; steers to live RBI rates. |
| 6.2 | Fundamentals INR context | ⚠️ | Live currency facts for every non-USD ticker, plus the INFY INR/USD mismatch warning. The "~22x" and "83–86 INR/USD" figures were not hardcoded: they go stale (USD/INR is ~95.8 today). Promoter holding comes from NSE filings. **Pledging is still unavailable**: NSE's endpoint returns empty and screener's public page has no pledge data (checked 2026-09-21). Related-party, PSU and PLI notes ❌: generic advice the model already applies. |
| 6.3 | Sentiment India context | ✅ | `sentiment_analyst.py` routes to and describes the India subreddits. |
| 6.4 | Market analyst India context | ⚠️ | India VIX ✅. Expiry volatility ✅ (weekday not named). "Round-number levels" ❌: unfalsifiable folklore. |
| 7.1 | NSE module | ✅ | See 3.3. |
| 7.2 | India news RSS | ✅ **completed 2026-09-22** | Economic Times + Mint for macro (`india_news.py`), and **Google News India for company news** (`google_news_india.py`), now first in the news chain. Yahoo returned *zero* articles for four Nifty names that week; Google News returned 36–100 each. Business Standard 403s; Financial Express serves HTML. |
| 7.3 | NSE corporate announcements | ✅ | Plus triage: routine filings are summarised, material ones quoted. |
| 7.4 | SEBI filings scraper | ❌ | Superseded: NSE shareholding and announcements cover the promoter and acquisition cases. Pledging is the gap (see 6.2). |
| 7.5 | India VIX | ✅ | See 6.4. |
| 8 | Known gaps table | — | Updated in place below: each row now states its status. |
| 9 | Quick reference | ✅ fixed | Dead symbols corrected: `TATAMOTORS.NS`→`TMCV.NS`, `^CNXMIDCAP`→`NIFTY_MIDCAP_100.NS`, `^CNXSMALLCAP`→`^CNXSC`. `INTDSRINM193N` is marked dead. |

**Unverified numbers in the original text.** The "Nifty-VIX correlation ~0.7",
"<10 StockTwits posts" and "800K+ members" figures have no source. Treat them
as colour, not facts to cite.

## 1. Quick Start — What Works Today

These things work **right now, out of the box** for Indian tickers:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OHLCV price data | Works fully | Use `.NS` (NSE) or `.BO` (BSE) suffix |
| Technical indicators (MACD, RSI, BB) | Works fully | Via stockstats on yfinance data |
| Fundamental data (P/E, EPS, revenue) | Works fully | yfinance covers Nifty 500 well |
| Balance sheet / income statement | Works fully | INR-denominated, quarterly/annual |
| Cash flow statement | Works fully | — |
| Insider transactions | Partial | yfinance has limited India insider data |
| Benchmark auto-selection | Built-in | .NS maps to ^NSEI, .BO maps to ^BSESN |
| INR forex pair (USDINR) | Built-in | Resolves to USDINR=X |
| News (yfinance) | Works | English-language, Reuters/ET/Mint articles |

**To run an analysis on an Indian stock right now:**

```bash
# NSE stock
python main.py --ticker RELIANCE.NS --date 2025-06-15

# BSE stock
python main.py --ticker HDFCBANK.BO --date 2025-06-15
```

---

## 2. Priority 1 — Configuration Changes (Zero Code)

> These are **immediate wins** achievable by editing `.env` or passing config — no code changes required.

### 2.1 Set India-First Macro News Queries

**File:** `tradingagents/default_config.py` — `global_news_queries` key

Replace the default US-centric macro queries with India-first equivalents:

```python
# Pass this config when creating TradingAgentsGraph
config = {
    "global_news_queries": [
        # India macro — primary
        "RBI repo rate monetary policy India inflation",
        "Nifty 50 BSE Sensex earnings GDP India economic outlook",
        "SEBI regulation FII DII institutional flows India",
        "India Union Budget fiscal deficit tax policy",
        "rupee USD INR exchange rate RBI intervention",
        # Global macro — secondary (keep for FII context)
        "Federal Reserve interest rates emerging markets",
        "oil crude Brent commodity prices India",
        "China slowdown global trade India exports",
    ],
    "global_news_lookback_days": 7,
    "global_news_article_limit": 15,
}
```

### 2.2 Disable or Repurpose FRED (US Macro)

FRED covers US indicators only. For Indian stocks, it is **tertiary context at best**.

**Option A — Disable FRED entirely** (saves API calls and token budget):
```python
config = {
    "data_vendors": {
        "macro_data": "",  # Agent gets DATA_UNAVAILABLE sentinel
    }
}
```

**Option B — Keep FRED but use India-relevant global series** (recommended):
```
# Fed/DXY still affects FII flows into India — keep FRED, but instruct
# the news analyst to pull India FRED series (see Section 3).
```

### 2.3 Set Benchmark Explicitly

```python
config = {
    "benchmark_ticker": "^NSEI",   # Nifty 50 for NSE stocks
    # or "^BSESN" for BSE / Sensex comparison
}
```

Or via `.env`:
```env
TRADINGAGENTS_BENCHMARK_TICKER=^NSEI
```

### 2.4 Output Language

```env
TRADINGAGENTS_OUTPUT_LANGUAGE=English
# For Hindi output (experimental):
# TRADINGAGENTS_OUTPUT_LANGUAGE=Hindi
```

---

## 3. Priority 2 — Indian Macro Data

> **The biggest gap**: FRED has zero India-specific indicators by default. But FRED actually hosts several India series via IMF/World Bank data that you can use immediately.

### 3.1 FRED India Series (Use Right Now — No New Code)

These are valid raw FRED series IDs — pass them directly to the existing `get_macro_indicators` tool:

| Series ID | Description | Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| `INDCPIALLMINMEI` | India CPI All Items (monthly) | RBI reaction function |
| ~~`INTDSRINM193N`~~ | ~~India RBI Lending Rate~~ | **Dead since July 2022 — use `rbi_rates.py`** |
| `INDIRLTLT01STM` | India 10Y Government Bond Yield | EM bond market |
| `DEXINUS` | USD/INR exchange rate (daily) | INR strength |
| `INDGDPRPCPPPT` | India GDP per capita (PPP) | Structural growth |

**Add these as friendly aliases to `tradingagents/dataflows/fred.py` `MACRO_SERIES` dict:**

```python
# India-specific additions — paste into MACRO_SERIES in fred.py
"india_cpi":         "INDCPIALLMINMEI",
"india_inflation":   "INDCPIALLMINMEI",
"rbi_lending_rate":  "INTDSRINM193N",   # DEAD: last updated July 2022 - do NOT use
"india_10y_yield":   "INDIRLTLT01STM",
"usdinr":            "DEXINUS",
```

### 3.2 FRED Global Series That Affect Indian Markets

| Alias | Why it Matters for India |
|---|---|
| `fed_funds_rate` | US rate hikes cause DXY strength and FII outflows from India |
| `dollar_index` | Strong dollar puts INR depreciation pressure |
| `10y_treasury` | US bond yield is the EM capital flight benchmark |
| `vix` | Global risk-off causes India selloffs (Nifty-VIX correlation ~0.7) |
| `real_gdp` | US GDP health drives IT/pharma export demand (TCS, Infosys, Sun Pharma) |

Crude oil note: India imports ~85% of crude — fetch `CL=F` via yfinance for oil price data.

### 3.3 NSE India API (No Key — Requires New Module)

NSE provides free public API data. A new `tradingagents/dataflows/nse_india.py` module can fetch:
- FII/DII daily net buy/sell figures
- India VIX
- Nifty option chain PCR (Put-Call Ratio — contrarian indicator)
- NSE corporate announcements

```python
# Base NSE API endpoints
NSE_BASE = "https://www.nseindia.com/api"
FII_DII_URL = f"{NSE_BASE}/fiidiiTradeReact"
INDIA_VIX_URL = f"{NSE_BASE}/allIndices"
OPTION_CHAIN_URL = f"{NSE_BASE}/option-chain-indices?symbol=NIFTY"
# Note: NSE API requires browser-like session cookies. Use requests.Session()
# with a prior GET to https://www.nseindia.com to obtain the session.
```

### 3.4 RBI Data Warehouse (DBIE)

The RBI DBIE portal (`dbie.rbi.org.in`) exposes free REST endpoints for:
- Repo rate history, CRR/SLR
- WPI / CPI
- Forex reserves, external debt

---

## 4. Priority 3 — Sentiment and Social Data

> **Second biggest gap**: Reddit (r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, r/investing) and StockTwits have very thin India coverage. Indian retail is on completely different platforms.

### 4.1 Where Indian Retail Discusses Stocks

| Platform | India Relevance | Access |
|---|---|---|
| r/IndiaInvestments | High — value investing, 800K+ members | Reddit RSS (free) |
| r/DalalStreet | High — NSE/BSE focused | Reddit RSS (free) |
| r/IndianStreetBets | High — WSB-style, high-energy | Reddit RSS (free) |
| Twitter/X cashtags | Very high — retail + institutional | X API v2 (paid) |
| Telegram channels | Very high retail volume | Telegram Bot API (free) |
| Moneycontrol forums | High — India's largest finance site | Scraping only |
| StockTwits | Low — Indian stocks have less than 10 posts | Already integrated |

### 4.2 Quick Win — Add Indian Subreddits (1-Line Change)

**File:** `tradingagents/dataflows/reddit.py`, line 74

```python
# BEFORE (US-focused):
DEFAULT_SUBREDDITS = ("wallstreetbets", "stocks", "investing")

# AFTER (India-first):
DEFAULT_SUBREDDITS = (
    "IndiaInvestments",    # 800K+ members, high quality long-term discussion
    "DalalStreet",         # NSE/BSE specific trading
    "IndianStreetBets",    # High-energy retail sentiment
    "stocks",              # Keep for cross-listed ADRs (Infosys, WIT, etc.)
    "investing",           # Keep for global macro context
)
```

> This is the **single highest-impact code change** for Indian sentiment quality.

### 4.3 Quick Win — Fix StockTwits Indian Ticker Symbols

Indian tickers on StockTwits do not include the exchange suffix. `RELIANCE.NS` must be searched as `RELIANCE`.

**File:** `tradingagents/dataflows/stocktwits.py`, `_stocktwits_symbol()` function

```python
def _stocktwits_symbol(ticker: str) -> str:
    """Map to StockTwits convention.
    StockTwits: crypto as BTC.X, Indian stocks without .NS/.BO suffix.
    """
    base = crypto_base(ticker)
    if base:
        return f"{base}.X"
    # Strip Indian exchange suffixes
    clean = ticker.strip().upper()
    for suffix in (".NS", ".BO", ".BSE", ".NSE"):
        if clean.endswith(suffix):
            return clean[: -len(suffix)]
    return clean
```

### 4.4 Medium-Term — Twitter/X Cashtag Monitoring

Indian retail sentiment on X is extremely high-signal, especially around:
- RBI policy dates (quarterly)
- Budget day  
- Nifty option expiry (weekly Thursdays)
- FII buying/selling days

The X API v2 Basic tier ($100/month) supports cashtag search. Build `tradingagents/dataflows/twitter_india.py`.

---

## 5. Priority 4 — Market Structure Awareness

> Indian markets have structural rules that agents are currently unaware of.

### 5.1 NSE/BSE Trading Hours (IST = UTC+5:30)

| Session | Time (IST) |
|---|---|
| Pre-open | 9:00 AM – 9:15 AM |
| Regular trading | 9:15 AM – 3:30 PM |
| Post-close | 3:40 PM – 4:00 PM |
| Closed | Saturdays, Sundays, NSE holidays |

### 5.2 Key India Calendar Events

| Event | Frequency | Market Impact |
|---|---|---|
| RBI Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) | Bi-monthly (6x/year) | Very High — rate decisions |
| Union Budget | Annual (Feb 1) | Very High — sector allocations |
| NSE F&O Weekly Expiry | Every Thursday | High — Nifty/BankNifty volatility |
| NSE Monthly Expiry | Last Thursday | Very High — rollover activity |
| TCS/Infosys/HCL Earnings | Quarterly (Apr/Jul/Oct/Jan) | High — IT bellwether |
| Advance Tax installment dates | Mar 15, Jun 15, Sep 15, Dec 15 | Medium — institutional selling |
| FII/DII data release | Daily EOD | High — flow direction |
| India CPI release | Monthly (~12th) | High — RBI reaction |
| India IIP data | Monthly (~12th) | Medium — industrial output |
| GST collections | Monthly (1st of next month) | Medium — consumption proxy |
| Monsoon progress | June–September | High — agri/FMCG/rural demand |

### 5.3 SEBI Market Microstructure Rules

- **Index circuit breakers**: 10%, 15%, 20% drops trigger 45-min, 1h45m, and full-day halts
- **Stock circuit breakers**: 5%, 10%, 20% daily limits (varies by circuit category)
- **T+1 settlement**: Since Jan 2023 — important for liquidity/cash management
- **F&O position limits**: SEBI caps are much tighter than US options; relevant for volatility analysis

### 5.4 NSE Sector Indices for Peer Comparison

> **Checked 2026-09-22:** only ^NSEBANK, ^CNXIT and ^CNXPHARMA have price *history* on Yahoo;
> the rest return today's quote only. Implemented with peer baskets instead (`india_relative.py`).

| NSE Sector Index | Key Stocks | Yahoo Symbol |
|---|---|---|
| Nifty Bank | HDFCBANK, ICICIBANK, KOTAKBANK | ^NSEBANK |
| Nifty IT | TCS, INFY, WIPRO, HCL | ^CNXIT |
| Nifty Pharma | SUNPHARMA, DRREDDY, CIPLA | ^CNXPHARMA |
| Nifty Auto | MARUTI, TMCV (ex-TATAMOTORS), BAJAJ-AUTO | ^CNXAUTO |
| Nifty FMCG | HINDUNILVR, ITC, NESTLEIND | ^CNXFMCG |
| Nifty Metal | TATASTEEL, JSWSTEEL, HINDALCO | ^CNXMETAL |
| Nifty Energy | RELIANCE, ONGC, POWERGRID | ^CNXENERGY |

---

## 6. Priority 5 — Agent Prompt Improvements

### 6.1 News Analyst — India-Aware Macro Instructions

**File:** `tradingagents/agents/analysts/news_analyst.py`

Detect the Indian ticker and override the macro guidance in `system_message`:

```python
is_india = ticker.upper().endswith((".NS", ".BO"))

if is_india:
    macro_guidance = (
        "For India macro context, call get_macro_indicators with: "
        "'INDCPIALLMINMEI' (India CPI), 'DEXINUS' (USD/INR rate), "
        "'fed_funds_rate' (US Fed — "  # INTDSRINM193N removed: dead since 2022
        "affects FII flows into India), 'vix' (global risk-off proxy), "
        "'dollar_index' (DXY strength impacts INR and FII inflows into India). "
        "Key India catalysts: RBI MPC decisions, Union Budget announcements, "
        "NSE F&O expiry weeks, FII/DII flow direction, India CPI/IIP releases, "
        "GST collection data, monsoon progress for agri/FMCG/rural demand."
    )
```

### 6.2 Fundamentals Analyst — INR and India-Specific Context

**File:** `tradingagents/agents/analysts/fundamentals_analyst.py`

Add this to the system message for Indian tickers:

```
When analyzing Indian companies:
- Financials are in INR. Crores (1 Cr = 10M INR) and Lakhs (1 L = 100K INR) are standard.
- Benchmark P/E against Nifty 50 median (~22x historically), not S&P 500.
- Promoter holding percentage is critical. Promoter share pledging is a major bearish signal.
- FII ownership changes quarter-over-quarter signal institutional confidence direction.
- Debt-to-EBITDA matters more than in the US due to India's higher interest rate environment.
- Watch for related-party transactions, common in Indian conglomerates.
- For PSU (Public Sector Undertaking) stocks, factor in government capex policy and disinvestment risk.
- Government policy changes (PLI schemes, Make in India) are material for manufacturing stocks.
```

### 6.3 Sentiment Analyst — India Social Media Context

**File:** `tradingagents/agents/analysts/sentiment_analyst.py`

Add to `_build_system_message()` for Indian tickers:

```
For Indian stocks, r/IndiaInvestments, r/DalalStreet, and r/IndianStreetBets are
the primary retail sentiment signals — not r/wallstreetbets. StockTwits coverage
for Indian stocks is typically thin (under 20 messages); weight it accordingly and
lower confidence if the sample is small. Yahoo Finance news for Indian tickers
surfaces Economic Times, Mint, Business Standard, and Reuters India — these are
high-quality institutional sources. Be explicit when data is sparse.
```

### 6.4 Market Analyst — India Technical Context

**File:** `tradingagents/agents/analysts/market_analyst.py`

Add awareness of:
- India VIX (`^INDIAVIX`) as the domestic fear gauge (distinct from CBOE VIX)
- Weekly Thursday F&O expiry creates artificial intraday and weekly volatility
- Nifty 50 key psychological levels (round numbers like 22000, 24000, 25000 are frequently cited)

---

## 7. Priority 6 — New Data Sources to Add

> These require new code but would deliver the largest coverage improvements.

### 7.1 NSE India Module — FII/DII and Option Chain (Very High Impact)

Create `tradingagents/dataflows/nse_india.py`:

```python
"""NSE India public API data fetcher.

Provides FII/DII daily flows, India VIX, Nifty option chain PCR,
and corporate action announcements — all without an API key.

Note: NSE requires a browser-like session. Initialize with a GET
to https://www.nseindia.com/ before any API call to obtain cookies.
"""
import requests

NSE_BASE = "https://www.nseindia.com/api"
NSE_HEADERS = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.9",
    "Referer": "https://www.nseindia.com/",
}

def _get_session() -> requests.Session:
    session = requests.Session()
    session.get("https://www.nseindia.com/", headers=NSE_HEADERS, timeout=10)
    return session

def get_fii_dii_data(curr_date: str) -> str:
    """Fetch FII and DII daily net buying/selling figures."""
    # Returns markdown table of FII/DII activity
    ...

def get_india_vix(curr_date: str) -> str:
    """Fetch India VIX value. VIX>20=elevated fear, VIX>30=extreme fear."""
    ...

def get_nifty_pcr(curr_date: str) -> str:
    """Fetch Nifty Put-Call Ratio. PCR>1.2 is bullish, PCR<0.8 is bearish."""
    ...
```

### 7.2 Indian Financial News RSS Feeds (High Impact)

Create `tradingagents/dataflows/india_news.py` using free RSS feeds:

```
Economic Times Markets RSS:
  https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/rssfeeds/2146842.cms

Mint Markets RSS:
  https://www.livemint.com/rss/markets

Business Standard Markets RSS:
  https://www.business-standard.com/rss/markets-106.rss

Financial Express Markets RSS:
  https://www.financialexpress.com/market/feed/
```

Integrate via the existing `VENDOR_METHODS` / `interface.py` pattern as a new `india_news` vendor.

### 7.3 NSE Corporate Announcements (High Impact)

SEBI mandates all filings to NSE/BSE. Fetch via:
```
https://www.nseindia.com/api/corporates-corporateActions?index=equities
```

Data includes: board meeting dates, dividend/bonus announcements, insider disclosures, block/bulk deals, and credit rating changes. Far more useful for Indian stocks than yfinance's generic insider transactions.

### 7.4 SEBI Filings Scraper (Medium Impact)

SEBI's public portal (`efts.sebi.gov.in`) has all regulatory filings for:
- Promoter shareholding changes and pledging disclosures
- Creeping acquisition notices
- DRHP filings (for IPO peer context)

### 7.5 India VIX Integration (Medium Impact)

Add `^INDIAVIX` as a standard market-context indicator:

```python
# In market analyst or news analyst
india_vix_data = get_YFin_data_online("^INDIAVIX", start_date, end_date)
# Reference levels: <12 = complacency, 12-20 = normal, 20-30 = fear, >30 = extreme fear
```

## 8. Known Gaps and Honest Limitations

| Gap | Status | Where / workaround |
|---|---|---|
| No RBI repo rate as a friendly FRED alias | ✅ Resolved | Live from rbi.org.in (`rbi_rates.py`); INTDSRINM193N is dead |
| Reddit India subreddits not in defaults | ✅ Resolved | Region-routed (reddit.py) |
| StockTwits has thin India coverage | ✅ Mitigated | Verified ADR allowlist; thin by nature |
| No FII/DII flow data | ✅ Resolved | nse_india.py |
| No India VIX integration | ✅ Resolved | Market analyst guidance + NSE level |
| No Moneycontrol or ET dedicated news vendor | ✅ Resolved | ET + Mint RSS for macro; Google News India for company news, incl. Moneycontrol headlines |
| No India F&O/derivative awareness in prompts | ✅ Resolved | Expiry guidance + live Nifty PCR |
| FRED still fetches US macro by default | ✅ By design | DXY/VIX/Fed drive FII flows |
| No GST/IIP/PMI data integration | ❌ Open | No free structured API; see future_plans.md |
| Promoter pledging data unavailable | ❌ Open | NSE endpoint empty, screener has none; see future_plans.md |
| Historical FII/DII data limited | ❌ Open | Still true; historical runs get a sentinel |
| No monsoon/agricultural data integration | ❌ Open (low) | IMD has no clean API; news covers it |
