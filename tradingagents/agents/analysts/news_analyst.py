# India-specific macro aliases resolve through FRED's MACRO_SERIES table
# (tradingagents/dataflows/fred.py) — sourced from IMF/OECD and slower-moving
# than the domestic US series, so the guidance below asks for the as-of date
# rather than implying central-bank-fresh data. RBI policy rates are NOT
# among them: FRED's India discount-rate series stopped updating in 2022,
# so the live repo/SDF/MSF/CRR/SLR are scraped from RBI and injected as
# part of the market context block below (see india_context).

    "— but only report them as fact when a tool result or explicit context "
