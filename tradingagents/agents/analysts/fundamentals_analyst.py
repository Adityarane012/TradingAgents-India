# Promoter shareholding used to be listed here as simply unavailable. It is
# now fetched from NSE filings and injected below (india_context), so this
# note no longer claims it is missing — telling the model data is absent when
# the prompt contains it is its own kind of wrong. What remains genuinely
# unavailable is promoter *pledging* (no free source found) and the FII/DII
# split within public holding (NSE's shareholding-pattern endpoint reports
# only promoter vs public). Those are still named as unavailable rather than
# demanded, because a prompt that insists on a number the model cannot see
# invites it to invent one.
