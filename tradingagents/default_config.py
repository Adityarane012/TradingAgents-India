# Zero-cost preset. Every entry below was chosen against a measured free-tier
# limit rather than a marketing page (checked 2026-09-20):
#
#   Gemini free tier  - the binding limit is REQUESTS PER DAY, and the real
#                       number came from the 429 itself, not from any docs
#                       page: "generate_content_free_tier_requests, PerDay,
#                       limit: 500". Published guides say 1,000 for
#                       flash-lite; this key gets 500. Measured on a real
#                       50-ticker run (2026-09-20): 500 requests covered ~33
#                       tickers, so a ticker costs ~15 requests (four
#                       analysts plus researchers, trader, risk and
#                       portfolio, each analyst running a short tool-call
#                       loop). Budget ~15/ticker against YOUR key's own
#                       PerDay limit -- read it off a 429 rather than
#                       trusting a table, since it varies.
#   Groq free tier    - 30 req/min but only 6,000 tokens/min. A single market
#                       analyst turn can exceed that on its own, which is why
#                       an earlier Groq batch run died on rate limits.
#   OpenRouter :free  - 20 req/min but 50 req/day at zero balance: about 3
#                       tickers a day. Fine for a one-off, not for a universe.
#   Ollama            - genuinely unlimited and offline, but quality and speed
#                       depend on local hardware, and small local models are
#                       unreliable at the structured output and tool calls this
