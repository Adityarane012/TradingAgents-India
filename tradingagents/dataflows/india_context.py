"""Assembles NSE data into the context blocks injected into analyst prompts.

**Why injected rather than exposed as an LLM tool.** Every other market data
source here is a tool the analyst chooses to call. This one is pre-fetched and
pasted into the prompt, like the sentiment analyst's news/StockTwits/Reddit
blocks, for three reasons:

1. Tool-calling is the least reliable part of the free-tier providers this
   project's batch runner targets — Groq rejected the sentiment analyst's
   structured tool call outright, and a 50-ticker run cannot afford a retry
   loop per analyst.
2. The market-wide figures (FII/DII, India VIX, Nifty PCR) are identical for
   every ticker in a batch. Fetched once and cached (nse_india's TTL caches),
   they cost one HTTP call per run instead of one per analyst per ticker.
3. There is nothing for the model to choose: unlike ``get_macro_indicators``,
   which takes a series name, these blocks have no parameters worth varying.

The cost of that choice is that the model cannot ask for a different date, so
each block states its own as-of date and the analyst is told to read it.

Every block degrades to a ``<... unavailable: ...>`` sentinel rather than
raising or going silent, so a blocked NSE never fails an analysis — the
analyst simply sees that the data could not be fetched and says so.
