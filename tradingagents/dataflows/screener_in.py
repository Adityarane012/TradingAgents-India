"""screener.in company data: the FII/DII ownership split and headline ratios.

**Why this exists alongside the NSE fetcher.** NSE's shareholding-pattern
endpoint reports promoter vs public as a single split — it does not break the
public half into foreign (FII) and domestic (DII) institutions. That split is
one of the most-watched signals for an Indian company (Reliance's FII holding
fell from 22.60% to 17.19% over twelve quarters while DII rose from 15.99% to
21.10% — a story neither the aggregate nor the price shows), and it is what
the fundamentals prompt otherwise has to declare unavailable. screener.in
publishes it, server-rendered, alongside ROCE/ROE/P-E and the shareholder
count.

**Opt-in, and off by default** (``screener_enabled``). screener.in is a
third-party site with no API, and its terms grant personal, non-commercial
viewing. This module is written for personal/testing use of the project: one
polite request per company, throttled, cached for the session, with an
identified User-Agent rather than a spoofed browser one. It is not switched on
for anyone by default, and NSE remains the primary source for everything both
of them carry.

**Live-only.** The shareholding columns are labelled by quarter end (``Jun
2026``), not by the date the filing became public, and the ratios are current
by definition. Without a publication date there is no way to know what was
public on a past date, so a historical run is refused rather than served
figures that may postdate it. NSE's fetcher, which does carry filing dates,
handles the point-in-time case for promoter holding.

**Cross-checked, not trusted.** Where NSE covers the same number (promoter
holding), the block reports a disagreement rather than silently preferring
one: on 2026-09-20 both reported Reliance at 50.48%.
