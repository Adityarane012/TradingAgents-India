"""Indian financial news RSS fetcher — an alternate get_global_news vendor.

Yahoo Finance search (the yfinance vendor behind get_global_news) has thin
coverage of Indian market news. Economic Times and Mint both publish free,
keyless RSS feeds with dense India-specific markets coverage, so this module
plugs in as another VENDOR_METHODS["get_global_news"] entry — selectable via
``data_vendors: {"news_data": "india_rss"}`` (or a fallback chain like
``"india_rss,yfinance"``) — rather than a separate tool needing its own agent
wiring.

Feed selection: candidates floated for this also included Business Standard
and Financial Express, but checked live (2026-09-17): Business Standard's
markets RSS returns HTTP 403 (blocked for non-browser clients), and the
commonly-cited Financial Express "market/feed" URL serves an HTML page, not
RSS. Both were dropped rather than shipped as vendor entries that always
fail.

Not made the default: unlike yfinance (Yahoo's search API, broadly stable),
two RSS feeds are a much smaller, more failure-prone surface — either
publisher can change its feed path or format without notice. Users who want
India-specific macro news opt in explicitly via data_vendors.
